# GitHub Repository Setup Instructions

Since GitHub CLI is not available, please follow these steps to create and upload your POS system to GitHub:

## Step 1: Create Repository on GitHub

1. Go to [GitHub.com](https://github.com) and sign in to your account
2. Click the "+" icon in the top right corner and select "New repository"
3. Fill in the repository details:
   - **Repository name**: `pos-system`
   - **Description**: `A modern Point of Sale (POS) system built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Features product management, shopping cart, payment processing, and receipt generation.`
   - **Visibility**: Public
   - **Initialize**: Do NOT check "Add a README file" (we already have one)
4. Click "Create repository"

## Step 2: Connect Local Repository to GitHub

After creating the repository, GitHub will show you the commands to run. Use these commands in your terminal:

```bash
cd /Users/kelvin/Developer/Kuliah/FE/UTS
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/pos-system.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` with your actual GitHub username.

## Step 3: Verify Upload

1. Go to your new repository on GitHub
2. You should see all the files:
   - `index.html`
   - `styles.css`
   - `script.js`
   - `README.md`

## Alternative: Using GitHub Desktop

If you prefer a GUI approach:

1. Download and install [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/)
2. Open GitHub Desktop
3. Click "Add an Existing Repository from your Hard Drive"
4. Navigate to `/Users/kelvin/Developer/Kuliah/FE/UTS`
5. Click "Publish repository" and follow the prompts
